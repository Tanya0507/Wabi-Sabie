                <h2>FIFA 22</h2>
                <p>Release date: 30 Sep, 2021</p>
                <p>Rating: 7/10 IGN   76% PC Gamer   3/5 NDTV Gadgets 360</p>
                <p>EA Sports has pumped out yet another incremental update to its football simulation series. FIFA 22’s graphical upgrades and new animation technology make the beautiful game feel better, with goals demanding a more deliberate and rewarding playstyle. Tiny tweaks also improve FIFA 22’s Career Mode and Volta Football ahead of a proper revamp. However, aside from those minor but largely positive changes, this is the same game in a new pair of pants – which means its microtransactions are just as eager as ever to get you to turn your pockets inside out.</p>

                <p>Release date: 26 October 2021</p>
                <p>Rating: 77% Metacritic
                  5/5 Common Sense Media
                  4/5 Trusted Reviews</p>
                <p> Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy, also published by Square Enix, has flown in to save the day. With no microtransactions, no multiplayer, and a relatively meaty story, it’s further proof that linear, single-player campaigns haven’t gone anywhere. Its simple but entertaining combat and fairly straightforward level design won’t revolutionize the genre or anything, but those solid fundamentals and the metric ton of personality slathered on top of them are more than enough to make Guardians of the Galaxy some good old-fashioned fun.</p>

                <h2>Valorant</h2>
                <p>Release date: 2 June 2020</p>
                <p>Rating: 90% PC Gamer
                  9/10 IGN
                  8/10 PCGamesN</p>
                <p>Nail-biting bomb plants, hip fire headshots, and magical flicks of the wrist are the tenets of Valorant. A single match from the closed beta of League of Legends developer Riot’s new 5v5 tactical hero shooter was enough to pique my curiosity. Now, 20 hours later, I'm utterly enamored with the brilliant implementation of its superpowered cast, superb gunplay and I’m gradually getting over my initial distaste for the art style. The learning curve is steep, but once the cogs of mastery started clicking for me, I could barely put Valorant down.</p>
                <p>Valorant's high-stakes round-based shootouts are immediately familiar. Teams are divided into two groups: attackers and defenders. Attackers carry the spike (a bomb) to one of several designated bombsites on a map, plant that sucker, and hopefully blow everyone sky-high. The defenders counter the attacker's strike by attempting to kill them all off before they can pull that off, or by defusing the spike once it's planted. Either fulfill your team's objective or mow down the opposition to secure a victory, whatever works! Win 13 rounds and you’ll emerge from the match victorious.</p>

                <h2>Call of Duty: Warzone</h2>
                <p>Release date: 10 March 2020</p>
                <p>Rating: 82% PC Gamer
                  7/10 IGN
                  4/5 PCMag</p>
                <p>The Call of Duty: Warzone beta takes a vastly different approach than most other battle royales. Death is an inconvenience rather than the end, top-tier weapons are consistently easy to come by, and skill will only get you so far when there are no more armor plates to loot. While that means it excels at being accessible and easy to pick up, it pays a high cost where depth is concerned. Solos manage to get all of the good without very much of the bad from these trade offs, but the same can’t be said when you squad up. Still, the impressive 150 player count, tried and tested arsenal from Modern Warfare, and well-crafted, massive map consistently deliver excellent firefights even if they sometimes lack the genre’s high stakes and endless variety.</p>
                <p>Like Blackout before it, Warzone’s Verdansk battle royale map mashes up several familiar locations from Call of Duty’s past, albeit on a much larger scale. Verdansk is massive, dwarfing its predecessor and then some. And for a space this vast with a 150-player capacity, Warzone’s performance on PC impressed me as I rarely experienced frame drops or connectivity problems, which feels like a triumph in this context. I did have some trouble with mantling onto ledges in certain areas and the ping system just stops working if you try to use it at too long a range, not to mention that it isn’t nearly as intuitive or robust as the one found in Apex Legends. But these annoyances are very much the exception rather than the rule. You’ll be hard pressed to find an area devoid of well-crafted explorable structures brimming with weapons, supplies, and cash which can be redeemed at randomly placed buy stations for things like killstreaks, armor plates, or weaponry in loadout drops.</p>

                <h2>Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege</h2>
                <p>Release date: 26 November 2015</p>
                <p>Rating: 4.4/5 Common Sense Media
                  8.5/10 IGN
                  79% Metacritic</p>
                <p>Rainbow Six Siege pulls me in opposite directions at the same time. On the one hand, the moment-to-moment gameplay experience is fantastic. Every second of the short rounds matter, walls and floors won’t protect you, and sound tactics win matches. But, like other 2015 multiplayer-focused shooters such as Evolve and Star Wars Battlefront, there’s not a lot of there there. My time with Siege so far leaves me feeling like this Rainbow Six revival is a skeleton with not a lot of meat on its bones.</p>
                <p>Siege reboots the long-running Rainbow Six series as a five-on-five, attack-and-defend competitive shooter that’s as much about blowing holes in the world around you as in your opponents. Destruction is no gimmick; shooting through walls, blasting through floors and ceilings, and keeping as much of your corporeal Special Forces husk behind fragile cover during firefights is key to extending your life in each of the respawn-free modes. Using a gadget to detect the presence of an enemy and fragging them through what would, in most other first-person shooters, be an indestructible hunk of drywall isn’t just satisfying; it’s thrilling. And while Siege isn’t the best-looking shooter out there in terms of environmental detail or character models, it includes memorable touches like the arterial blood spray that coats the wall behind your target when you off them. It looks like something truly terrible happened in that spot.</p>

                <h2>Call of Duty: Vanguard</h2>
                <p>Release date: release date: 10 September 2021</p>
                <p>Rating: 82% Metacritic

                  3/5 Eurogamer</p>
                <p>Call of Duty Vanguard sees Call of Duty returning to its roots… once again. It does that a lot. The first multiplayer beta opened up this weekend for anyone who preordered on PlayStation, and I spent a fair number of hours getting my feet wet ahead of its November 5 release date. If you, like me, have been playing the last several iterations of CoD, you will probably feel a sense of familiarity with Vanguard's multiplayer. Actually, let me rephrase that: you might feel like this is last year's Call of Duty MP with a WW2 skin. The only thing keeping me playing Vanguard instead of going back to Black Ops Cold War are a few interesting new modes.</p>
                <p>Team Deathmatch, Kill Confirmed, and Domination are back, as you’d expect. However, Hardpoint, a mode I never really liked, has been changed to a new Patrol mode, which I definitely like. Rather than capture and hold static points, Patrol has you protecting a small circle of territory that moves along the map (hence the "Patrol" moniker). When a team of internet randos comes together to cover and capture this moving target, it's really fun. It's far and away my favorite addition to this year's multiplayer, as it encourages both active and passive team coverage and discourages camping. </p>

                <h2>League of Legends</h2>
                <p>Release date: 27 October 2009</p>
                <p>Rating: 9.2/10 IGN 3.7/5 Common Sense Media
                  78% Metacritic</p>
                <p>It was one of the first big free-to-play games, and one of the first big multiplayer online battle arenas, or MOBAs. But going on five years later, League of Legends still holds firm as an example of excellence. With its amazing variety of Champions, rewarding progression systems, and fast but intensely strategic team play, it easily hooked me and refused to let go. That addictiveness and competitive spirit, combined with a generous free-to-play approach and frequent updates from developer Riot Games, has created one of the biggest and liveliest gaming communities anywhere.</p>
