    </html><h1>Online Classes on the Art Market Are Inspiring a New Generation of Collectors</h1>

    <p>Navigating the art market can often feel like traversing a maze for which, by design, only a select few have a map. Magnus Resch—art market economist, Yale professor, serial entrepreneur, and best-selling author of six books on the art market, including the recently published How to Become a Successful Artist (2021)—aims to change that.</p>
    <p>Driven by a singular objective to make the market more transparent, accessible, and democratic, Resch’s work lies at the intersection of art, technology, and business.</p>
